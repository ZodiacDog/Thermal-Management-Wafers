## SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MITIGATION

### Critical Long-Lead Items

1. **AlN Substrates** (10-12 weeks)
   - Mitigation: 3-month strategic inventory
   - Dual source: Kyocera + CoorsTek

2. **Heat Pipe Assembly** (10-12 weeks)
   - Mitigation: In-house capability development
   - Dual source: Thermacore + ACT

3. **HIP Processing** (12-14 weeks)
   - Mitigation: Reserved capacity agreement
   - Backup: Sandvik (higher cost)

### Single-Source Risks

**Helium-4 (quantum variant):**
- Risk: Helium shortage, price volatility
- Mitigation: Long-term contract, 6-month inventory

**Ultra-high purity materials:**
- Risk: Limited suppliers
- Mitigation: Qualify alternate suppliers early
